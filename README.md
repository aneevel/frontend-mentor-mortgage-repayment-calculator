- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this solution, I got a bit more involved in the javascript and practiced a bit of client-side
validation. It was a rather straightforward way of doing validation, though it really only checks for
the presence of a value, not whether it matches the appropriate pattern or not.

I also got to explore the CSS 'filter' attribute, which allowed me to change the color of the radio
buttons. This was a fun little exploration, and gave me a few ideas of how I can create some interesting
visual effects for elements in the future.
